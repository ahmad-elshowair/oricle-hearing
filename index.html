                  >The biggest names in retail hearing aids like Miracle Ear,
                  Siemens and Oticon have been around for nearly 100 years. And
                  their outdated retail model, and outrageous pricing game has
                  largely stayed the same — and gone on for too long consumers
                  say.</strong

              <p>
                Especially in tough economic times, people no longer can, or
                want, to pay $5,000 to $10,000 for hearing aids that you can get
                for $100 — offering the same crisp, clear hearing, and even
                wireless charging.
              </p>
              <p>
                Not to mention, traditional, old fashioned hearing aid companies
                require customers to make an appointment to visit a hearing aid
                retail center in order to get what they need at sky high prices.
              </p>
              <p>
                But now, one company has disrupted the hearing aid industry and
                ushered in a New Era of Hearing Aids with a way to get
                high-quality hearing aids with NO visit, and without spending
                thousands of dollars.

                  miracle I tell you. They are as good as any of her friends
                  $2000+ hearing aids. Now she tells me I talk too loud and says
                  she can hear me just fine. She is happy and I am relieved!

                  because of the low price. I had misplaced my other set I got
                  from my doctor for $2500. So I decided to give these a try in
                  hopes I would find my lost set. After using the Oricle set,
                  they are so much better! Even if I find my lost set, I’ll

                  of which she lost 3 sets. Because she wears a hat most of the
                  time as well as glasses, she continually knocks them off so
